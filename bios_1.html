 <h2>Meet up</h2>

<p>The aim of meetups is to bring together cyber security speakers, researchers and enthusiasts to present and share their findings in their respective areas of expertise. The prime focus being cyber security education and awareness, it is community-driven and is always free for both the speakers and the audience. If you are looking for a platform to unveil your explorations, here it is!</p>

<h2>InCTF</h2>

<p>
InCTF, a Capture-The-Flag style contest, is to be viewed as a security exercise which provides an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Information Security and put them into practice. Hopefully you will have as much fun participating, as we have in organizing the event.

 <h2>InCTF Junior</h2>

<p>
A recent report has revealed that a miniscule 0.6% of graduate students are currently working in cyber security while cyber attacks and breaches are manifesting in the country. In order to encourage the youth to participate, they need to be taught at a young age about the importance of computer security. A lot of research have been proven to be the best way to approach this is Capture the Flag style contests. These contests typically simulate real life scenarios that enable participants to develop real world security skills. Many of the countries like USA and China have realized the need for cyber security education and are conducting CTF contests for school students. Having realized the dire need for such a training culture in India, Amrita University is organizing Amrita InCTF Junior, an online Capture the Flag style contest specifically designed to introduce cyber security awareness and training in high school students.
